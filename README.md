## General info
A fullstack application using a MongoDB database, Node and Express server, and React frontend. The application is built to practice several aspects of fullstack development- server side testing with **_**Jest**_**, authorization with **_**JWT**_**, and writing a backend with **mongoose**. On the frontend, Redux was used for more auth practice, while I also used two new technologies: **_**react-toastify**_** and **_**react-bootstrap**_**.
